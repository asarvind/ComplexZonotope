\begin{document}

\maketitle Models of hybrid systems, that describe the system dynamics
as an interaction between continuous and discrete variables, pose a
significant challenge for formal verification.  Verification of some
of the properties of these systems, like safety and stability, usually
requires computing the set of reachable states of the system.  For
hybrid systems that have differential equations, exact computation of
the reachable set is undecidable~\cite{alur1995algorithmic}, except in
particular cases~\cite{lafferriere1998decidable}.  Even in a simpler
case like a discrete time affine hybrid system, the exact reachable
set at any given time is a union of sets whose number is exponential
in the number of time steps.  An alternative is find a sufficiently
accurate over-approximation of the infinite set of reachable states.
To do so, we need to represent an infinite set of states symbolically
by a {\it set representation}, which can be efficiently manipulated
for the computation of the desired over-approximation.  Some examples
of a set representation are {\it convex polyhedron}, represented by
either linear
inequalities~\cite{cousot1978automatic,Sankaranarayanan+Dang+Ivancic-08-Symbolic,FLD+11}
or a convex hull of a finite set of points~\cite{kvasnica2004multi};
{\it
  ellipsoid}~\cite{DBLP:journals/tecs/AllamigeonGSGP16,kurzhanskiy2006ellipsoidal},
represented by a positive semi-definite matrix and a center; {\it
  polynomial sub-level
  sets}~\cite{DBLP:conf/esop/AdjeGG10,prajna2004safety} ; etc.  In
numerical abstract interpretation, a set representation is usually an
{\it abstract domain}, which is a lattice with an abstraction and a
concretization map~\cite{jeannet2009apron}.

\section{Motivation}
We consider the problem of efficiently computing a sufficiently
accurate over-approximation of the unbounded time reachable set that
is useful for verifying properties like invariance and stability.  The
unbounded time reachable set is usually approximated as a {\it
  positive invariant}, which is a set of states whose next set of
reachable states is contained within itself.  The potentiality of a
set representation for efficient computation of a positive invariant
of a hybrid system is affected by the following characteristics.  (i)
Closure of the set representation under set operations like linear
transformation, Minkowski sum, intersection and inclusion-checking,
etc, and efficient computation of the same.  (ii) Existence of a
positive invariant for the system that can be encoded by the set
representation. (iii) Efficient encoding of the positive invariant by
the set representation.  Well known set representations for computing
reachable sets have some of the above characteristics, but not all.
For example, polytopes have the advantage that they are closed under
linear transformation, Minkowski sum and intersection and for a stable
linear transformation, there exists a polytopic invariant.  However,
the Minkowski sum operation is costly because it can lead to a
quadratic increase in the number of vertices and an exponential
increase in the number of faces.  Also, the number of faces of a
polytopic positive invariant for a stable linear system can be
arbitrarily large.  Ellipsoids have the advantage that they are closed
under linear transformation and can also efficiently represent the
positive invariant of a stable linear transformation.  But ellipsoids
are not closed under Minkowski sum.  Recently work computes the
over-approximation of the Minkowski sum of ellipsoids by a minimum
volume ellipsoid~\cite{allamigeon2017fast}.  Still, there can be significant
approximation error in the ellipsoidal approximation of the Minkowski
sum.


\paragraph{Real zonotope, its usefulness and drawback.}
Zonotope~\cite{DBLP:conf/hybrid/Girard05} is yet another set
representation, which is specified as a linear combination of real
vectors and a center, such that the absolute values of the combining
coefficients are bounded within unity.  Geometrically, a zonotope is
the Minkowski sum of line segments and hence a type of polytope.
Zonotopes have also been extended to the more general quadratic
zonotopes~\cite{DBLP:conf/aplas/AdjeGW15}, which is a quadratic
function of real valued intervals.  Zonotopes have the advantage that
they are efficiently closed under linear transformation and Minkowski
sum operations.  Therefore, they have been successfully applied to the
computation of bounded time reachable sets of uncertain continuous
linear systems~\cite{DBLP:conf/hybrid/Girard05} and affine hybrid
systems with simple
switching~\cite{makhlouf2014networked,girard2008zonotope}.  But for
over-approximation of the {\it unbounded time reachable set by a
  positive invariant}, real zonotopes have the have the following
drawback.  We can not guarantee the existence of real zonotope which
is a positive invariant, for the case of a stable linear transformation
having complex eigenvalues.  When the eigenvectors of a stable linear
transformation are real valued, then collecting the eigenvectors of
the matrix among the generators of the zonotope gives a positively
invariant real zonotope.  However, this result does not hold when the
eigenvectors have complex values, i.e., have non-zero imaginary and
real parts.



\section {Main Contribution}
\paragraph{Complex zonotope.}  To address the above drawback of real
zonotopes, we extend them to the complex valued domain to yield a set
representation called {\it complex zonotope}.  A basic representation
of a complex zonotope, which is a straightforward extension of the real
zonotope, is a linear combination of complex valued vectors with
complex combining coefficients, whose absolute values are bounded
within unity.  We show that a complex zonotope captures contraction
along the complex valued eigenvectors of a linear transformation,
which relates to existence of a positively invariant complex zonotope.
The real projection of a complex zonotope can represent not only
Minkowski sums of line segments, but also some ellipsoids.  Hence,
they can represent non-polyhedral sets as well as polytopic zonotopes.
They are different from quadratic
zonotopes~\cite{DBLP:conf/aplas/AdjeGW15}, because while the latter
is a quadratic function of real valued intervals, a complex zonotope
is a complex linear combination of circles in the complex plane.

\paragraph{Template complex zonotope.}  To find more accurate approximations
of a given set using a basic representation of a complex zonotope, we
can not simply add more generators because it only increases the size
of the complex zonotope.  Moreover, adding generators can violate the
positive invariance of the complex zonotope.  An alternative way of
refining the complex zonotope is to modify the measure of contribution
of each generator to the size of the set.  In this regard, we propose
the more general {\it template complex zonotope} representation, where
the absolute values of combining coefficients have variable bounds
called scaling factors.  The scaling factors can be adjusted to find
better over-approximations.  Furthermore, it allows adding arbitrary
generators to the collection of generators, called the {\it template},
because the scaling factors can adjusted to any value equal to or
greater than zero.

{\it Advantage over other set representations}: Just like simple
zonotopes, template complex zonotopes are also closed under linear
transformation and Minkowski sum operations and the resultant complex
zonotopes can be computed efficiently.  This is an advantage over
ellipsoids which are not closed under Minkowski sum.  Additionally, we
show that template complex zonotope can efficiently represent a
positive invariant for a linear transformation, by collecting the
eigenvectors of the linear transformation as vectors in the template.
This is an an advantage over real zonotopes, where we can not
guarantee if a positive invariant, represented as a real zonotope,
exists when the eigenvectors are complex valued.  This is also an
advantage over polytopes, where the representation size of a positive
invariant as a polytope can be arbitrarily large.

{\it Inclusion-checking}: We propose a sufficient condition for
checking inclusion between template complex zonotopes, expressed as a
second-order conic (convex) constraint on the scaling factors
and other auxiliary variables.  This condition is useful in practice,
which we demonstrate through our experiments in invariance and stability
verification on some benchmark examples.

\paragraph{Augmented complex zonotope.}  Template complex
zonotopes are not closed under intersection with sub-level sets of
linear inequalities.  This is also a drawback of real zonotopes.
Previous work addressed this drawback for real zonotopes by allowing
linear constraints on the combining coefficients, in more general
representations like constrained affine sets~\cite{Ghorbal2010} and
{\it constrained zonotopes}~\cite{scott2016constrained}.  But we face
the following problem if we were to emulate these approach for complex
zonotopes.  The absolute value bounds on combining co-coefficients,
which are quadratic functions, are necessary because they capture the
contraction along complex valued eigenvectors of a linear
transformation.  Consider that we additionally define linear
constraints on the complex valued combining co-coefficients to reason
about intersection.  Then the problem of finding a reasonable
convex-relaxation for inclusion-checking between elements in the
resultant set representation, which works well in practice, seems
intractable.  Instead, we define a representation called {\it
  augmented complex zonotope}, which is geometrically equivalent to a
complex zonotope, but whose representation is more general and allows
efficient computation of a non-trivial over-approximation of the
intersection with a class of linear constraints.  The
over-approximation is computed as a simple algebraic expression of the
parameters of the augmented complex zonotope.  The augmented complex
zonotope representation is motivated by the constrained affine
sets~\cite{Ghorbal2010} abstract domain.  But the difference is that
while a constrained affine set is geometrically not a zonotope, an
augmented complex zonotope is geometrically equivalent and can be
converted efficiently to the template complex zonotope.  Therefore, we
can efficiently check-inclusion between augmented complex zonotopes
using the condition for checking-inclusion between template complex
zonotopes.  In the course of the derivation of this result about
intersection, we also find a general mathematical result about
intersection of Minkowski sum of convex sets with another convex set.

\paragraph{Invariance verification.}
Henceforth, we derive a second order conic program for checking the
invariance of linear constraints for a discrete time affine hybrid
system.  The fact that a complex zonotope can both capture the
contraction along complex eigenvectors and also efficiently represent
linear transformation and Minkowski sum makes it an efficient set
representation for unbounded time safety verification.  We demonstrate
the efficiency of the safety verification approach by implementing on
some benchmark examples and comparing with the SpaceEx
tool~\cite{FLD+11} and available results for previous approaches.

\paragraph{Stability verification of nearly periodic linear impulsive
  systems.}  %% The specification of an augmented complex
%% zonotope has a complex matrix, called {\it primary template}, a real
%% matrix called {\it secondary template}, the center of the constituting
%% template complex zonotope, called {\it primary offset}, bounds on the
%% absolute values of the complex combining co-efficients, called {\it
%%   scaling factors} and the {\it lower and upper interval bounds} on
%% the real combining co-efficients.
 %% These
%% expressions are affine functions of the primary offset, scaling
%% factors and lower and upper interval bounds. 
  Our analysis of template complex zonotopes for the case of discrete
  time switched linear systems is extended to verify stability of {\it
    nearly periodic linear impulsive systems}.  The efficiency of our
  approach to stability verification is demonstrated by our
  experiments on some benchmark experiments.  We obtain either larger
  or competitive bounds on the maximum uncertainty in sampling times
  compared to previous approaches.

\section {Organization}
The dissertation contains five main chapters and a conclusive chapter.
In Chapter 1, we briefly discuss the use of set representation for
computing reachable sets of hybrid systems and the desirable
characteristics of a good set representation.  In light of these
characteristics, we provide a short review of some set representations
that discusses their advantages and drawbacks.  Then we review
simple/real zonotopes and the commonly used operations on them in
reach set computation.  We also review the definitions polynomial and
constrained zonotopes, which are previously known extensions of the
simple zonotope.  Then we shall describe the shortcoming of the real
zonotope in computing a positive invariant.

In Chapter 2, we introduce the complex zonotope set representation
that addresses the drawback of real zonotope described in the previous
chapter.  We define the basic representation of a complex zonotope and
state a result about how a complex zonotope can efficiently represent
a positive invariant for a stable linear transformation based on the
eigenstructure.  Next we define the more general template complex
zonotope representation, which permits a way of refining a complex
zonotope while approximating a given set.  We discuss operations on
template complex zonotopes that are used in reach set computation and
derive a second order conic program for checking inclusion between
template complex zonotopes.  Using the results, we derive a second
order conic program for unbounded time safety verification of linear
systems and illustrate it with an example.

In Chapter 3,
we introduce augmented complex zonotopes for computing non-trivial
intersection with a class of sub-level sets of linear inequalities
called sub-parallelotopes.  Apart from the intersection, we discuss
other operations on augmented complex zonotope used in the computation
of reachable sets.  Also, we state a second order conic program for
checking inclusion between augmented complex zonotopes.

In Chapter 4, we apply augmented complex zonotopes for unbounded time
safety verification of affine hybrid systems.  We derive a second
order conic program for checking safety, which is based on computing a
suitable positively invariant augmented complex zonotope.  We
implement the approach on some benchmark examples to demonstrate its
efficiency.

In Chapter 5, we apply template complex zonotopes for verifying
exponential stability of linear impulsive systems with sampling time
uncertainty.  We discuss a procedure for stability verification, which
consists of synthesizing a possibly contractive template complex
zonotopes and verifying their contraction.  We implement this
procedure on some benchmark examples to demonstrate its efficiency.

The concluding remarks are stated in Chapter 6.
