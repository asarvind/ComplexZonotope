\section{Contributions}
The complex zonotope set representation provides a computationally
efficient framework for utilizing the complex valued eigenstructure of
affine hybrid systems for their verification, while retaining the
essential computational advantages of real zonotopes.  We have
developed practical algorithms using complex zonotopes for
verification of linear invariance properties of discrete time systems
and exponential stability of linear impulsive systems.  We summarize
the main contributions of this dissertation below.
