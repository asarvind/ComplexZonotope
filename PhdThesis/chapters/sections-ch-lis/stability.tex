A nearly periodic linear impulsive system is globally exponentially
stable (GES) if any point in the state space reaches arbitrarily close
to the origin at an exponential rate.  This property is mathematically
stated as follows.
%
\begin{defn}\label{defn:exp-stable}[Global exponential stability] The
system~(\ref{eqn:system}) is said to be globally exponentially stable
(GES) if there exist $\lambda\in[0,1)$ and $c>0$ such that for all $\initstate
\in\mb{R}^n$ and $k\in\mb{Z}_+$,
$||\tbf{x}_k||\leq c\lambda^k||\tbf{x}_0||$.
\end{defn}
%
The GES of a system is related to the reachable sets of the
system. Indeed if all bounded sets containing the origin eventually
contract to arbitrarily small sets around the origin, then every point
eventually reaches close to the origin and the system is thus
GES. Instead of verifying the contraction of all bounded sets
containing the origin, we can verify the contraction of any compact
and convex set containing the origin, because it can be scaled to
include any bounded set. We
call such sets as $C$-sets.

The contractiveness of a set is defined as follows.
%
\begin{definition}[\cite{todo:all}]
Given $\lambda\in[0,1]$, a set $C$-set $\Psi\subset\reals^n$ is
$\lambda$-contractive for the system $\system$ iff
\[\forall x\in\Psi,~\forall t\in\Delta,~H_tx\in\lambda\Psi.\]
\end{definition}
%
The following is the stability verification problem.
%
\begin{problem}
Given a sampling period interval $\Delta=[\lsb,\usb]$, verify
that the system $H$ is globally exponentially stable.
\end{problem}
%
\begin{remark} It has been shown previously
in~(\cite{2014-fiacchini-set,athanasopoulos2014alternative,AlKhatib2015})
that the globally exponentially stablility of the system is equivalent
to the existence of a $\lambda$-contractive $C$-set for a
$\lambda\in[0,1)$, as stated in the following theorem.
\end{remark}
%
Therefore, the global exponential stability of the system can be
verified by finding a contractive $C$-set.  A stability verification
algorithm was proposed in~\cite{todo} that definitely computes a
contractive $C$-set for a globally exponentially stable system.
However, the algorithm in~\cite{todo} involves iterative
intersections, where the complexity of the set can grow in size during
recursion.  Therefore, the algorithm can be costly, especially in
higher dimensions.  Alternatively, in this paper we propose an
algorithm that synthesizes a possibly contractive complex zonotope by
convex optimization and later verifies its contraction.  Although the
existence of a contractive complex zonotope is only a sufficient
condition for global exponential stability, we demostrate that our
procedure by experiments on some benchmar examples.  Our procedure for
stability verification, which we describe in the next section, shall
use some properties of contraction of sets that we shall discuss now.

Since the state change of the system can be identified by the
transformation by a reachability operator, we define contraction by
a matrix as follows.  From here on, $J$ denotes an
$n\times n$ real matrix.
%
\begin{defn} The amount of contraction of a set
  $\Psi\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ upon transformation by the matrix $J$,
  denoted as $\chi(\Psi,J)$, is $$\chi(\Psi,J) =
  \inf\{a\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} : J(\Psi)\subseteq a
  \Psi\}.$$ \end{defn}
% \begin{defn} The amount of contraction of a set $\Psi\subset\mathbb{R}^n$
% after $k$ steps for some $k\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, denoted by  $\chi_k(\Psi)$, is
% $$\chi_k(\Psi)=\inf\{a\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} : R^k(\Psi)\subseteq a\Psi\}.$$  
% %We shall denote the contraction of $\Psi$ after $k$ steps as $\chi_k(\Psi)$.
% \end{defn}
The amount of contraction being greater than one would indicate that
the set is actually \emph{expanding}, which also will be referred in
general
as ``contraction'' sense in our paper.
