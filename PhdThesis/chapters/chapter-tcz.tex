In the previous chapter, we have explained the advantage of simple
zonotopes that they are closed under linear transformation and
Minkowski sum operations and these can be computed efficiently.
Regarding computation of a positive invariant real zonotope for a
linear system, we showed in Proposition~\ref{prop:eig-rztope} that it
can be done efficiently when the eigenvectors are real valued.
However, when the eigenvectors of a stable linear system are complex
valued, we can not guarantee the existence of a non-zero real
zonotopic positive invariant.  Overcoming this drawback of real
zonotopes, we extend them to a new class of sets called \emph{complex
zonotopes} by which we can easily specify positive invariants of a
stable linear system using the eigenstructure.  Complex zonotopes have
complex valued generators complex combining coefficients bounded in
their absolute values, as opposed to the real valued generators and
real combining coefficients of simple zonotopes.  Complex zonotopes
are also geometrically more expressive, since their real projections
can describe Minkowski sums of some ellipsoids along with line
segments.  Moreover, complex zonotopes retain the merit of real
zonotopes that they are closed under linear transformations and
Minkowski sums and these can be computed efficiently.  We also derive
a convex program for checking inclusion between two complex zonotopes.
The inclusion relation is a key ingredient for efficient invariant
computation, which we shall discuss in latter chapters.

This chapter is organized into three main sections.  In
Section~\ref{sec:representation}, we shall introduce the basic
representation of a complex zonotope that naturally extends the
Definition~\ref{defn:rztope} of real zonotopes.  Further on, we shall
introduce a more general but geometrically equivalent representation,
called \emph{template complex zonotope}, which allows efficient
modification of complex zonotopic sets for increasing accuracy of
abstraction of sets.  In Section~\ref{sec:operations-tcz}, we shall
discuss basic operations on a template complex zonotope like linear
transformation, Minkowski sum and computation of support function.  In
Section~\ref{sec:inclusion-tcz}, we shall derive a convex program for
checking the inclusion between two template complex zonotopes.

%% Lemmas~\ref{lem:lin-transform}
%% and~\ref{lem:min-sum}, if the initial set is
%% $\init=\tcztope{\inittemp}{\initcen}{\initsfact}$ and the input set is
%% $\inputset=\tcztope{\inputtemp}{\inputcen}{\inputsfact}$, then the
%% reachable set at a time point is computed as
%% %
%% \begin{align}
%% & \reachset{t}=\tcztope
%% {% template
%% \minsum{A^t\inittemp}{\lt(\sum_{i=0}^{t-1}A^i\rt)\inputtemp}
