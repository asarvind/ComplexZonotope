In the previous chapter, we described a set representation called
simple zonotope, which is a type of polytope represented as a linear
combination of real valued vectors with bounded combining
coefficients.  The advantage of simple zonotopes in set based
computations is that they are closed under matrix multiplication and
Minkowski sum operations and these can be computed efficiently.
However, for computing a positive invariant of a linear system, there
is no known procedure to choose a suitable set of generators for a
simple zonotope so as to compute an invariant.  In this chapter, we
extend simple zonotope a new set representation called \emph{complex
zonotope} by which we can easily specify invariants of a linear system
using the eigenstructure of the system.  Complex zonotopes have
complex valued generators complex combining coefficients bounded in
their absolute values, as opposed to the real valued generators and
real combining coefficients of simple zonotopes.  The real projections
of complex zonotopes can describe some non-polytopic sets in addition
to the polytopic zonotopes, which are Minkowski sums of some
ellipsoids along with line segments.  Furthermore, complex zonotopes
are also closed under matrix multiplications and Minkowski sums and
these can be computed efficiently.

Apart from discussing operations on complex zonotopes like linear
transformations and Minkowski sums, in this chapter we derive a convex
program for checking inclusion between two complex zonotopes.  The
inclusion relation is a key ingredient for efficient invariant
computation, as we shall see in the latter chapters.  The organization
of this chapter is as follows.  PUT ORGANIZATION.
