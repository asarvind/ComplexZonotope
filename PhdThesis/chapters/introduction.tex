\section{Review of set representations and related work}
We shall briefly review some of the set representations that are
mainly used in the reachability analysis of hybrid systems,
particularly focusing on affine hybrid systems.  Along the way, we
also discuss the related work and draw comparison with our complex
zonotopes.  We categorize the set representations into four classes
and discuss them in separate sections: polytopes, zonotopes,
ellipsoids and polynomial sub-level sets.  Reachability analysis
techniques using non-convex polytopes generally extend techniques used
for convex polytopes.  Therefore, we review convex polytopes instead
of polytopes.  Although zonotopes are a sub-class of polytopes, we
discuss them in a separate section.  We particularly focus our review
on real zonotopes since our work extends them to complex zonotopes.
