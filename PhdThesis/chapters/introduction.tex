\section{Review of set representations and related work}
We shall briefly review some of the set representations that are
mainly used in the reachability analysis of hybrid systems,
particularly focusing on affine hybrid systems.  Along the way, we
also discuss the related work and draw comparison with our complex
zonotopes.  Most of these set representations can be broadly
classified by three categories discussed in separate sections:
polytopes, ellipsoids and polynomial sub-level sets.  Reachability
analysis techniques using non-convex polytopes generally extend
techniques used for convex polytopes.  Therefore, we review convex
polytopes instead of polytopes.  Although zonotopes are a sub-class of
polytopes, we discuss them in a separate section.  We particularly
focus our review on real zonotopes our work extends them to complex
zonotopes.
