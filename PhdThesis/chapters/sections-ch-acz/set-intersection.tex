We shall now introduce the augmented complex zonotope set
representation and describe the over-approximation of its intersection
with a sub-parallelotope.  In Lemma~\ref{lem:motivation}, we have shown that the
intersection of a suitably aligned interval zonotope with a
sub-parallelotope can be computed exactly by a simple algebraic
formula.  Afterwards, in Lemma~\ref{lem:minsum-intersection}, we gave
an over-approximation and also an under-approximation of the intersection
between a sub-parallelotope and the Minkowski sum of a convex set with
interval zonotope.  Motivated by this, we specify an augmented complex zonotope
as a Minkowski sum of a template complex zonotope and an interval
zonotope.  The idea behind such a representation is that the interval
zonotope part is used to compute the intersection with a
sub-parallelotope, while the template complex zonotope may capture
positive invariance based on complex eigenstructure.
%
\begin{definition}
Let us consider a template complex zonotope
$\tcztope{\ptemp}{\cen}{\sfact}\subseteq\compnums^n$ and an interval
zonotope $\iztope{\stemp}{\lb}{\ub}\subseteq\reals^n$.  Then the
following is the representation of an augmented complex zonotope.
%
\[
\acztope{\ptemp}{\cen}{\sfact}{\stemp}{\lb}{\ub}=\minsum{\tcztope{\ptemp}{\cen}{\sfact}}{\iztope{\stemp}{\lb}{\ub}}.
\]
%
\end{definition}
%
Now we give an over-approximation as
an augmented complex zonotope for the
the intersection between an augmented complex zonotope and a
sub-parallelotope.  We also derive a bound on the over-approximation
error expressed in terms of the Haussdorf distance.

We recall the notation used in Lemma~\ref{lem:minsum-intersection}.
