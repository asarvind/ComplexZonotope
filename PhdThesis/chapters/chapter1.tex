In the previous chapter, we described a set representation called
simple zonotope, which is type of polytope represented as a linear
combination of real-valued vectors with bounded combining
co-efficients.  The advantage of simple zonotopes in set based
computations is that they are closed under matrix multiplication and
Minkowski sum operations and these can be efficiently.  However, for
invariant computation, there is no known procedure to choose a
suitable set of generators for a simple zonotope so as to compute an
invariant.  In this chapter, we extend simple zonotope a new set
representation called \emph{complex zonotope} by which we can easily
specify invariants of a linear system using the eigenstructure of the
system.  Complex zonotopes have complex valued generators complex
combining co-efficients bounded in their absolute values, as opposed
to the real valued generators and real combining co-efficients of
simple zonotopes.  The real projections of complex zonotopes can
describe some non-polytopic sets in addition to the polytopic  
zonotopes, which are Minkowski sums of some ellipsoids along with line
segments.  Furthermore, complex zonotopes are also closed under matrix
multiplications and Minkowski sums and these can be computed
efficiently.

Apart from discussing operations on complex zonotopes like linear
transformations and Minkowski sums, in this chapter we derive a convex
program for checking inclusion between two complex zonotopes.  The
inclusion relation is a key ingredient for efficient invariant
computation, as we shall see in the latter chapters.  The organization
of this chapter is as follows.  PUT ORGANIZATION.

\section{Motivation}
When the eigenstructure of a linear system is real, it can be used to
specify a real zonotopic positive invariant for the system.  This is
based on the following result.
%
\begin{proposition}
Let us consider a simple zonotope centered at the origin
$\rztope{V}{0}$, where the column vectors of $V\in\mat{m}{n}{\reals}$
are the eigenvectors of a matrix $A\in\mat{n}{n}{\reals}$ such that
$AV = V\diagonal(\mu)$ where $\mu\in\reals^m$ is a vector of eigenvalues
corresponding to the eigenvectors among the columns of $V$.
Then \[A\lt(\rztope{V}{0}\rt) = \rztope{V\diagonal{\mu}}{0}.\] If
$\infnorm{\mu}\leq 1$, then
$A\lt(\rztope{V}{0}\rt)\subseteq \rztope{V}{0}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We have $A\lt(\rztope{V}{0}\rt) = \rztope{AV}{0}$ according to
Proposition~\ref{toref}.  Next $\rztope{AV}{0}
= \rztope{V\diagonal{\mu}}{0}$.  This proves the first part of the
Proposition.  For the second part, we are given that
$\infnorm{\mu}\leq 1$.  Let $y\in A\lt(\rztope{V}{0}\rt)
= \rztope{V\diagonal{\mu}}{0}$.  So, we can write $y$ as $y =
V\diagonal{\mu}\delta:\infnorm{\delta}\leq 1$.  Let $\epsilon
= \diagonal{\mu}\delta$. Then
$\infnorm{\epsilon} \leq \infnorm{\mu}\infnorm{\delta} \leq 1$.  So,
$y=V\epsilon$ where $\infnorm{\epsilon}\leq 1$,
and hence $y\in \rztope{V}{0}$.  Therefore,
$A\lt(\rztope{V}{0}\rt)\subseteq \rztope{V}{0}$.
\end{proof}
%
The above proposition means that we can easily specify a positively
invariant simple zonotope for a stable discrete time linear system
with real eigenstructure by having only the (real) eigenvectors of the linear
system as the generators of the zonotope.

%% We have $A\lt(\polytope{J}{d}\rt)=A\lt\{x\in\reals^n:Jx\leq
