Physical systems controlled by digital logic exhibit a mix of
continuous dynamics, described by differential or difference
equations, and discrete dynamics described by switching of boolean
variables.  Mathematical models describing the behavior of such
systems are called \emph{hybrid systems}.  Formal verification of
hybrid systems generally requires computing the set of reachable
states of the system.  But exactly computing the reachable states of a
hybrid system is either undecidable or computationally expensive.  For
hybrid systems that have differential equations, exact computation of
the reachable set is undecidable~\cite{alur1995algorithmic}, except in
particular cases~\cite{lafferriere1998decidable}.  Even in a simpler
case like a discrete time affine hybrid system, the exact reachable
set at any time is a union of sets whose number is exponential
in the number of time steps.  An alternative is find a sufficiently
accurate over-approximation of the infinite set of reachable states.
To do so, we need to represent an infinite set of states symbolically
by a {\it set representation}, which can be efficiently manipulated
for the computation of the desired over-approximation.


Verification of some properties of hybrid systems requires
over-approximating the unbounded time reachable set of a system.  The
unbounded time reachable set be over-approximated by
a \emph{positive invariants}, which is a set whose next set of
reachable states is contained within itself.  The efficiency, in terms
of accuracy and computational speed, for positive
invariant based verification using a set representation, is related
to the following characteristics of the set representation.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Closure under set operations and computational complexity of
performing these operations, some of which are linear transformation,
Minkowski sum, intersection, computation of support function and
inclusion-checking.
\item Efficient encoding of positive invariants in the set representation.
\end{enumerate}
%
Well known set representations have some of the above characteristics,
but not all.  For example, polytopes have the advantage that they are
closed under linear transformation, Minkowski sum and intersection.
However, for a half-space representation of a polytope, the Minkowski
sum operation is computationally expensive in higher dimensions.
Moreover, to our knowledge, there is no upper bound on the
representation size of a non-zero polytopic positive invariant for a
stable linear system.  Ellipsoids have the advantage that they are
closed under linear transformation and also efficiently encode the
positive invariant of a stable linear system.  But ellipsoids are not
closed under Minkowski sum and intersection with half-spaces.
Although there has been work on over-approximation of the Minkowski
sum and intersection with half-spaces for
ellipsoids~\cite{allamigeon2017fast,kurzhanskiy2006ellipsoidal}, still there can be a significant
approximation error.

Zonotope~\cite{DBLP:conf/hybrid/Girard05} is yet another set
representation, which is a type of polytope specified as a linear
combination of real vectors whose combining coefficients are bounded
in the interval $[0,1]$.  Geometrically, they are Minkowski sums of
line segments.  Zonotopes have the advantage that they are closed
under linear transformation and Minkowski sum operations, which can
also be computed efficiently.  Therefore, they have been successfully
applied to the computation of bounded time reachable sets of uncertain
continuous linear systems~\cite{DBLP:conf/hybrid/Girard05} and affine
hybrid systems with simple
switching~\cite{makhlouf2014networked,girard2008zonotope}.  But
for over-approximation of the {\it unbounded time reachable set by a
positive invariant}, real zonotopes have the have the following
drawback.  We can not guarantee the existence of positively invariant
real zonotope for the case of a stable linear transformation having
complex eigenvalues.  We shall show that when the eigenvectors of a
stable linear transformation are real valued, then collecting the
eigenvectors of the matrix among the generators of the zonotope gives
a positively invariant real zonotope.  However, this result does not
hold when the eigenvectors have complex values, i.e., have non-zero
imaginary and real parts.

To address the above drawback of real zonotopes, we extend them to the
complex valued domain to yield a set representation called {\it
complex zonotope}.  A complex zonotope, is a linear combination of
complex valued vectors with absolute valued bounds on the combining
coefficients.  A complex zonotope can capture contraction along the
complex eigenvectors of a linear system, due to which they can
efficiently encode non-zero positive invariants of a linear system.  A
complex zonotope is also geometrically more expressive because its
real projection can represent not only Minkowski sums of some
ellipsoids in addition to line segments.  They are also different from
other extensions of complex zonotopes, like quadratic
zonotopes~\cite{DBLP:conf/aplas/AdjeGW15}, which we shall explain
later in a separate section.  Still, complex zonotopes retain the
merit of real zonotopes that they are closed under linear
transformation and Minkwoski sum, which can also be computed
efficiently.  In Table~\ref{tab:compset}, we draw comparison of complex
zonotopes with four categories of set representations comprising
convex polytopes, zonotopes, ellipsoids and polynomial sub-level sets.
A review of the other set representations and related work on
computing positive invariants will be presented in a separate section.

We apply complex zonotopes to two problems in the domain of hybrid
systems that require computing accurate positive invariants.  One
problem is verifying \emph{linear invariance properties} of discrete
time affine hybrid systems.  A linear invariance property is a linear
contraint on the state of the system that is satisfied by all the
reachable states.  We derive a convex program based for computing
positively invariant complex zonotopes that verify a linear invariance
property.  We demonstrate the efficienty of our method by experiments
on some benchmark examples.  The other problem is verifying stability
of linear impulsive systems with sampling uncertainty.  We develop an
algorithm that finds a contractive complex zonotope using the
eigenstructure of the system.  Our experiments on two benchmark
examples show either better or comparable performance compared to
other approaches.
