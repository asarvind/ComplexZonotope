A simple zonotope is a linear combination of real valued vectors plus a
center, such that the absolute values of the real valued combining
co-efficients are bounded within unity.  Geometrically speaking, a
simple zonotope is a Minkowski sum of line segments.  The
representation of a simple zonotope is given below.
%
\begin{definition}[Simple zonotope]
Let us consider $\ptemp\in\reals^m$, whose column vectors are called
{\it generators}, and $\cen\in\reals^n$.  The following is the
representation of a real zonotope.
%
\begin{align*}
\rztope{\ptemp}{\cen}=\set{\cen+\ptemp\zeta:~\zeta\in\reals^m,~\infnorm{\zeta}\leq 1}.
\end{align*}
%
\end{definition}
%
A main advantage of the zonotope set representation is not only that
they are closed under linear transformation and Minkowski sum, but
these can also be computed efficiently.  The linear transformation of
a zonotope is computed as follows.  For the rest of this chapter, we
use the notation $\ptemp\in\reals^m$ and $\cen\in\reals^n$, unless
otherwise sepcified.
%
\begin{lemma}[Linear transformation]
Let $A\in\mat{n}{n}{\reals}$.  Then
%
\begin{align*}
A\rztope{\ptemp}{\cen}=\rztope{A\ptemp}{A\cen}
\end{align*}
%
\end{lemma} 
%
\begin{proof}
We derive the following.
%
\begin{align*}
&
  A\rztope{\ptemp}{\cen}=A\set{\cen+\ptemp\zeta:~\zeta\in\reals^m,~\infnorm{\zeta}\leq
    1}\\
& = \set{A\cen+A\ptemp\zeta:~\zeta\in\reals^m,~\infnorm{\zeta}\leq 1}=\rztope{A\ptemp}{A\cen}.\hspace{3em}\qedhere
\end{align*}
%
\end{proof}
%
The Minkowski sum of two zonotopes can be computed as follows.
%
\begin{lemma}[Minkowski sum]
Let us consider two matrices $\ptemp\in\mat{n}{m}{\reals}$ and
$\ptemp^\pr\in\mat{n}{r}{\reals}$.  Then the following is true.
%
\begin{align*}
& \rztope{\ptemp}{\cen}\oplus\rztope{\ptemp^\pr}{\cen^\pr}
 \rztope{\mymatrix{\ptemp & \ptemp^\pr}}{\cen+\cen^\pr}.  
\end{align*}
%
\end{lemma}
%
\begin{proof}
We derive the following.
%
\begin{align*}
& \rztope{\ptemp}{\cen}\oplus\rztope{\ptemp^\pr}{\cen^\pr}\\
& = \set{\cen+\ptemp\zeta:~\zeta\in\reals^m,~\infnorm{\zeta}\leq
    1}\oplus\set{\cen^\pr+\ptemp^\pr\zeta^\pr:~\zeta^\pr\in\reals^r,~\infnorm{\zeta^\pr}\leq
    1}\\
& =
  \set{\lt(\cen+\cen^\pr\rt)+\ptemp\zeta+\ptemp\zeta^\pr:~\zeta\in\reals^m,\zeta^\pr\in\reals^r,~\infnorm{\zeta}\leq
    1,\infnorm{\zeta^\pr}\leq 1}\\
& = \set{\lt(\cen+\cen^\pr\rt)+\mymatrix{\ptemp
      &\ptemp^\pr}\mymatrix{\zeta\\\zeta^\pr}:~\mymatrix{\zeta\\\zeta^\pr}\in\reals^{m+r},~\infnorm{\mymatrix{\zeta\\\zeta^\pr}}\leq
    1}\\
& =  \rztope{\mymatrix{\ptemp & \ptemp^\pr}}{\cen+\cen^\pr}.\hspace{3em}\qedhere
\end{align*}
%
\end{proof}
%
Because of efficient computation of linear transformation and
Minkowski sum operations, simple zonotopes have been sucessfully
applied for bounded time computation of uncertain linear systems and
some hybrid systems with simple switching conditions~\cite{todo}.
However, for unbounded time computation of reachable sets, which
generally requires computing positive invariants, zonotopes have the
following drawback.  For the simple case of a stable linear system, we
do not know if a positively invariant non-zero zonotope exists.  For a
special case when a stable linear system (say discrete
time) has real eigenvalues, there exists a positively invariant
zonotope zonotope based on the following proposition.
%
\begin{proposition}
Let us consider $\ptemp\in\mat{n}{n}{\reals}$ consists
of the real eigenvectors of a matrix $A\in\mat{n}{n}{\reals}$ as
its column vectors and $\mu\in\reals^n$ be the vector of complex
eigenvalues, i.e., $A\ptemp
= \ptemp\diagonal{\mu}$.  Then \[A\lt(\rztope{\ptemp}{0}\rt)
= \rztope{\ptemp\diagonal{\mu}}{0}.\] If
$\infnorm{\mu}\leq 1$, then
$A\lt(\rztope{\ptemp}{0}\rt)\subseteq \rztope{\ptemp}{0}$.
\end{proposition}
% 
\begin{proof}
We derive
  %
\begin{align*}
& A\lt(\rztope{\ptemp}{0}\rt) =
A\set{\ptemp\zeta:~\zeta\in\reals^n,\infnorm{\zeta}\leq 1}\\
& =\set{A\ptemp\zeta:~\zeta\in\reals^n,\infnorm{\zeta}\leq 1}
= \rztope{A\ptemp}{0}=\rztope{\ptemp\diagonal{\mu}}{0}.
\end{align*}
%
which proves the first part of the
Proposition.

For the second part, we are given that $\infnorm{\mu}\leq 1$.
Consider a point
%
\begin{align*}
  & y\in \rztope{\ptemp}{0}=\rztope{\ptemp\diagonal{\mu}}{0}~~\text{where}\\
  &y = \ptemp\diagonal{\mu}\delta:\infnorm{\delta}\leq
1.
\end{align*}
%
Let $\zeta = \diagonal{\mu}\delta$. Then $\infnorm{\zeta} \leq
\infnorm{\mu}\infnorm{\delta} \leq 1$.  So,
%
\begin{align*}
  & y=\ptemp\zeta~~\text{ where }~
  \infnorm{\zeta}\leq 1.
\end{align*}
%
So, we get $y\in \rztope{\ptemp}{0}$.  As this is true for all $y\in
A\rztope{\ptemp}{0}$, we have
$A\lt(\rztope{\ptemp}{0}\rt)\subseteq
\rztope{\ptemp}{0}$ when $\infnorm{\mu}\leq 1$.
\end{proof}
%
A zonotope is not closed under mutual intersection or intersection
with half-spaces.  The computation of intersection with half-spaces is
used in reachability analysis of system having linear guards
(pre-conditions) for switching.  To address this problem, we may want
to convert a zonotope to a polytope and compute the intersection.
However, a zonotope with $m$ generators in an $n$ dimensional space
can have as many as $^{2m}C_{n-1}$ faces~\cite{todo}, which can be
exponential in $n$.  Therefore, the conversion of a zonotope to a
polytope can be costly in higher dimensions.  However, an algorithm
for the tight over-approximation of the intersection between a
zonotope and a hyperplane is proposed in~\cite{todo}, that is based on
the projection of the zonotope onto 2-dimensional hyperplanes.
Another approach is to extend the zonotope to a more general set
representation in which the intersection with a half-space is a closed
operation and can be computed efficiently.  Contrained zonotopes and
constrained affine sets are examples of such extensions, which are
closed under intersection with hyperplanes and halfspaces,
respectively.

In a constrained zonotope, in addition to the bound on the absolute
values of the combining coefficients, we can have linear equality
constraints.  Then, we can represent the intersection with a
hyperplane as a constrained zonotope.
