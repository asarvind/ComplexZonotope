A sub-level set of a polynomial is a natural extension of the
$H$-representation of the polytope to non-polytopic sets for
better approximation.  Mathematically, a polynomial sub-level
set is defined as follows.
%
\begin{definition}
A polynomial sub-level set is represented by a tuple $\lt(f,d\rt)$,
where 
$f\in\lt(\polyring{x_1,\ldots,x_n}{\reals}\rt)^r$ and $d\in\reals^r$,
which is assigned to the following set.
%
\[
\concrete{f,d}=\set{x\in\reals^n:~\forall
  i\in\set{1,\ldots,r},~f_i(x)\leq d_i}
\]
%
\end{definition}

In~\cite{duggirala2013safety}, it was shown that the safety
verification problem for linear systems is decidable when the initial
set is a sub-level set of eigen-functions, which can be quadratic
polynomials.  Our extension of real zonotopes to complex zonotopes
inspired by their work, which analyzes the eigenstructure of linear
systems.  In~\cite{Sriram}, positive invariants represented by
polynomial equalities are computed for a general class of hybrid
systems, where the polynomial is a linear combination of pre-chosen
templates that have to be guessed.  On the other hand, the method
of~\cite{tiwariRodriguezCarbonellPolynomialInvariants} computes
polynomial equality invariants for affine hybrid systems without
having to guess a template polynomial.  But~\cite{Sriram,tiwariRodriguezCarbonellPolynomialInvariants}
can not handle an additive disturbance input set having a non-empty
interior, because polynomial equalities represent hyper-surfaces which
have an empty interior.

On the other hand, polynomial sub-level sets specified by polynomial
inequalities can over-approximate sets having a non-empty interior.
But computing tight approximations of reachable sets by polynomial
sub-level sets requires non-convex
optimization which is expensive.
Alternatively, a method for computing positive invariants using
semi-definite relaxation and policy iterations is developed
in~\cite{DBLP:conf/esop/AdjeGG10}.  However, this approach uses a recursion
of convex optimization steps.  So, the convergence of the recursion
can be slower than polyhedral abstract domains, which generally use
linear programming in the recursion.  In contrast, our algorithm for
computing positive invariants using complex zonotopes has only a single step of convex optimization.
