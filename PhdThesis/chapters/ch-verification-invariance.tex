An invariant property of a system is a property that is true about the
state of the sytem at all time instants.  In many cases, a
safety condition can be expressed as an invariance property.  For
example, if a set of states of a system are considered safe, then the
safety condition is the invariance property that the state of the
system at all time instants should belong to the safe set.  We
consider the problem of verifying {\it linear invariance} property of
discrete time affine hybrid systems.  A linear invariance property is
a linear constraint (inequality) that will be true for the
state of the system at every time instant.   To prove a linear
invariance property, it suffices to compute a positive invariant
containing the initial state and contained within the intersection of
sub-level set of linear inequalities.  Our approach is to compute an
augmented complex zonotope, which is a positive invariant and
satisfies the given linear constraints.  We derive a second order
conic program to compute the required augmented complex zonotope
positive invariant.

This chapter is organized as follows.  In the following section, we
discuss some of the related work on the problem of computing positive
invariants for affine hybrid systems.  We discuss the advantage of the
complex zonotope set representation in comparison to the other
approaches, which was discussed in more detail in the introductory
chapter.  In Section~\ref{sec:hybrid-system}, we define a discrete time affine
hybrid system.  In Section~\ref{sec:linear-invariance}, we define a linear invariance
property, positive invariant and show how we can verify linear
invariance by finding a positive invariant.  In Section~\ref{sec:verification-invariance}, we
discuss our procedure for verification of linear invariance based on
computing an augmented complex zonotope positive invariant.  We derive
a set of convex constraints, which are collectively equivalently to
second order conic constraint, compute the desired augmented complex
zonotope.  We also explain how to choose the template of the augmented
complex template, which is fixed apriori, while other parameters are
found by convex optimization.  In Sections~\ref{todo},~\ref{todo},
and~\ref{todo}, we discuss our experiments on three benchmark examples
that demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.
