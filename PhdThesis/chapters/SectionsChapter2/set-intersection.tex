\section{Augmented Complex Zonotope and Intersection with Sub-parallelotope}
We shall latter introduce an augmented complex zonotope set
representation as a Minkowski sum of a template complex zonotope and
an interval zonotope.  To understand the motivation for introducing
the set representation, we shall derive a property about intersection
of Minkowski sums of two convex sets with another convex set.  The
derivation of the property requires some preliminary results about
convex sets, which are discussed below.

Let us define the support of a real vector $v\in\reals^n$ in a set
$S\subset\reals^n$ relative to a point $w\in\reals^n$ as
%
\[
\support{w}{v}{S}=\max_{x\in S}v^T\lt(x-w\rt).
\]
%
The following lemma
states a relationship between the support of vectors and inclusion
between convex sets.
%
\begin{lemma}~\label{supp-inclusion}
Let $S_1,S_2\subseteq \reals^n$ be two closed convex sets such that
$\intersection{S_1}{S_2}\neq \emptyset$.  Let $w\in \intersection{S_1}{S_2}$.
Then $S_1\subseteq S_2$ if and only if $\forall
v\in\reals^n:~\support{w}{v}{S_1}\leq \support{w}{v}{S_2}$.
\end{lemma}
%
\begin{proof}
Let us say that two convex and closed sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ have
non-empty intersection and $w$ is a common point, i.e., inside the
sets.  According to the above lemma, saying that $S_1$ is contained
inside $S_2$, is equivalent to saying that the maximum possible
displacement in $S_1$ from $w$ along the direction of any
vector $v$ is less than the maximum possible displacement in $S_2$
from $w$ along the direction of the vector $v$.

In Lemma~\ref{todo}, we had derived that the intersection of an
interval zonotope with a suitably aligned sub-parallelotope is
computed by a simple algebraic expression.  Therefore, to over-approximate
the intersection of the Minkowski sum of a convex set and an interval
zonotope with a sub-parallelotope
find a condition under which an intersection
%
\[
\intersection{\minsum{S_1}{S_2}}{S_3}
\]
%
can be over-approximated by 
we can overapproximate the intersection
