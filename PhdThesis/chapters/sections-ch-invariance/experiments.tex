We performed experiments on $3$ benchmark examples from the literature
and compared the results with that obtained by the tool
SpaceEx~\cite{FLD+11}, which performs verification by step-by-step
reachability computation. On one example, we compared the
computational time with the reported results of the MPT
tool~\cite{rakovic2004computation}.  For convex optimization, we used
CVX (version 2.1) with MOSEK solver (version 7.1) and Matlab (version:
8.5/R2015a) on a computer with 1.4 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and 4
GB 1600 MHz DDR3.  The precision of the solver is set to the default
precision of CVX.
