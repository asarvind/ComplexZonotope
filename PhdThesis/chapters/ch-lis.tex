A major approach to stability analysis of aperiodic sampling control uses time-delay 
systems, and stability can be proved using Lyapunov Krakovskii functionals 
\cite{Mikheev1988,Teel1998,2010-liu-stability,Mazenc2013}, 
or time-dependent Lyapunov functionals \cite{2010-fridman-refined}. Using a continuous-time model,  
discrete-time Lyapunov functions is proposed for stability condition \cite{2012-seuret-novel}, 
which can be checked using Sum of Squares (SOS) \cite{2013-seuret-stability}. Robust stability with respect to 
time-varying input delay can also be handled by input/output approach 
\cite{Mirkin2007,DBLP:journals/automatica/Fujioka09,DBLP:conf/amcc/KaoW14,Omran2013,Omran2014}.
Another important approach is based on the hybrid systems modeling framework, in particular time-varying impulsive systems 
\cite{Hu2003,nevsic2004framework,Goebel2009,Cai2008,BauLoo_NECSYS12a} and employs Lyapunov-based 
methods in various forms including discontinuous time-independent \cite{2008-naghshtabrizi-exponential} 
or time-dependent Lyapunov functions \cite{2010-fridman-refined}. Another popular 
approach involves using convex embedding \cite{HetelDaafouz2006,Fujioka2009,HetelKruszewski2011,2013hetel,Omran2014}. 
In this approach, stability tests can be formulated as parametric Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) \cite{HetelDaafouz2006}, 
or as set contractiveness (such as, polytopic set contractiveness is equivalent to polyhedral Lyapunov 
functions) \cite{2014-fiacchini-set,2013-briat-convex,Lazar2013,athanasopoulos2014alternative,AlKhatib2015}. 
In this work, we focus on exponential stability and are inspired by
set theory conditions
\cite{2014-fiacchini-set,athanasopoulos2014alternative,AlKhatib2015} to derive a stability condition which is more conservative 
but can be efficiently verified. The novelty of our work lies in the use of complex zonotopes to efficiently 
find contractive sets. Computationally speaking, our approach is close in spirit to abstract interpretation
and hybrid systems analysis. Indeed the way we find contractive sets using such zonotopes is similar 
to the way invariant sets are computed using some zonotopic
\cite{Girard05reachabilityof,Althoff2011,DBLP:conf/sas/GoubaultPV12} and
template-polyhedral abstract domains \cite{Sriram2008,jeannet2009apron}.
