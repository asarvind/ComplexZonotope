Compiling the repository
------------------------

<make> first cleans the repository, then recompiles all files and creates pdf.

<make pdf> Creates pdf without refreshing the auxillary files.  Use
      	   this for fast compilation if the auxillary files need not
      	   be changed.

Cleaning the repository
-----------------------

<make clean> Removes all auxillary files.

Uploading files to GitHub
--------------------------

<make upload> First cleans the repository and uploads only the files
      	      necessary for correct compilation.
