Before we introduce augmented complex zonotopes, we briefly review
related set representations and discuss our motivation for the
current extension. First, polytopes can be defined in terms of halfspace representation.
%
\begin{definition}
Let $T\in\mat{n}{k}{\mb{R}}$ and $d\in\mb{R}^k$.  Then a (possibly
unbounded) polytope, denoted $\polytope{T}{d}$, is defined as
$\polytope{T}{d} = \lt\{x\in\comprealset^k: Tx\leq d\rt\}$.
\end{definition}

combination of real vectors, called \emph{generators}, whose combining
coefficients are bounded in real valued intervals.
\begin{definition}[Real zonotope]
Let $W\in\mat{n}{k}{\mb{R}}$ and $l,u\in\mb{R}^m: l\leq u$.  Then 
 a real zonotope is
%\begin{equation*}
$\zon{W}{l}{u} = \lt\{W\zeta: \zeta\in\mb{R}^k,~\zeta_i\in[l_i,u_i]~\forall i\in \tup{k}\rt\}.$
%\end{equation*}
\end{definition}
%
For simple examples of zonotopes like boxes and octagons, efficient
<<<<<<< HEAD
interconversion between the zonotopic representation and halfspace polytopic representation is possible.  
However, in general,
zonotopes do not have efficient halfspace representation as a
polytope.  The reason is that a zonotope with $m$ generators in an $n$
dimensional space has ${m}\choose{n}$ faces (bounding
hyperplanes), if all combinations of $n$ generators are linearly
independent.  That is, the halfspace representation of a zonotope can
be exponentially large, compared to the above generator representation. 

Zonotopes are closed under linear transformations and Minkowski sums, which can be computed efficiently.  Hence, zonotopes are
considered efficient for reachability analysis of linear systems.  Nevertheless
a major drawback of zonotopes is that their intersection with sets defined by linear
constraints need not be zonotopes.  Also, there is no unique smallest
zonotope that overapproximates such intersections.  However, we observe that when the linear constraints
constitute a sub-parallelotope with a template aligned with that of
the zonotope, their intersection can be exactly computed.  This is
also the reason we considered the case of staying conditions and guards specified as sub-parallelotopes 
in the class of affine hybrid systems under study.  As a simple example, the intersection of

interconversion between the zonotopic representation and the

representation as a polytope.  The reason is that zonotope with $m$

The linear transformations and Minkowski sums of zonotopes are also
zonotopes, which can be computed efficiently.  Hence, zonotopes are
considered efficient for reachability analysis of linear systems.  But
the drawback with zonotopes is that the intersection with linear
constraints need not be a zonotope.  Also, there is no unique smallest
zonotope that overapproximates the intersected zonotope with linear
constraints.  However, we observe that if the linear constraints
constitute a subparallelotope with a a template aligned with that of

      1\end{array}\rt]}{\lt[\begin{array}{c}-1\\ -1\end{array}\rt]}{\lt[\begin{array}{c}2\\ 2\end{array}\rt]}$
with $x_1\leq 1~\wedge~x_2\geq 0.5$ gives $\zon{\lt[\begin{array}{l
        l}1 & 0 \\ 0 &
      1\end{array}\rt]}{\lt[\begin{array}{c}-1\\ 0.5\end{array}\rt]}{\lt[\begin{array}{c}1\\ 2\end{array}\rt]}$.
The general case is described in the following lemma.
%
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:motivation}
Let $K\in\mat{k}{n}{R}$ such that $k\leq n$ and $\lt(KK^T\rt)$ is
non-singular.  Then
\[
\zon{\pinv{K}}{l}{u} \bigcap \sptope{K}{\wh{l}}{\wh{u}}
= \zon{K}{l\bigvee \wh{l}}{u\bigwedge \wh{u}}
\]
\end{lemma}
%
To incorporate the possibly complex (having real and imaginary parts)
eigenstructure of linear maps while computing invariants, the complex
zonotope set representation and its generalization to the template
complex zontope were introduced in~\cite{adimoolam2016using,tcz2017}.
A template complex zonotope has complex valued vectors as generators,
whose combining coefficients are complex and bounded in their absolute
values.
%
\begin{definition}[Template complex zonotope]
Let $V\in\mat{n}{m}{\mb{C}}$ (template) and $s\in\mb{R}^m_{\geq 0}$ (scaling factors) and
$c\in\mb{C}^n$ (center).  Then the following is a template complex zonotope:
%\begin{equation*}
$\cz{V}{c}{s} =
\lt\{V\epsilon:\epsilon\in\mb{C}^m,~\lt|\epsilon_i\rt|\leq s_i~\forall
i\in\tup{m}\rt\}.$
%\end{equation*}
\end{definition}
%
Unlike real zonotopes, a template complex zonotope can have a
non-polyhedral real projection.  Therefore, in general, checking the
exact inclusion between two template complex zonotopes amounts to
solving a non-convex optimization problem, which could be computationally intractable.
Instead, a convex condition was proposed in~\cite{tcz2017}, which is
sufficient to guarantee the inclusion between template complex
zonotopes.  Here, we present this condition as a partial order between
template complex zonotopes.
%
\begin{definition}
We define a relation ``$\order$'' between template complex zonotopes
as\\ $\cz{V^\pr_{n\times m^\pr}}{c^\pr}{s^\pr}\order \cz{V_{n\times
    m}}{c}{s}$ if all of the below statements are collectively true.
\begin{align}~\label{eqn:tcz-inc}
\begin{split}
& \exists X\in\mat{m}{m^\pr}{\mb{C}}~\text{and}~y\in\mb{C}^{m}~\text{s.t.}\\
& \transfer{V}{V^\pr}{s^\pr}{X},~~~\centertransfer{V}{c}{c^\pr}{y}\\
& \scalebound{X}{y}{s}{m}{m^\pr}\leq 0\\
\end{split}
\end{align}
\end{definition}
%
\begin{lemma}[Ordering: template complex
  zonotopes]~\label{lem:zon-zon} The relation ``$\order$'' among
template complex zonotopes is a partial order.  Furthermore, the
inclusion $\cz{V^\pr}{c^\pr}{s^\pr}\subseteq \cz{V}{c}{s}$ holds if
the order relation $\cz{{V^\pr}}{c^\pr}{s^\pr}\order \cz{V}{c}{s}$ holds.
\end{lemma}
%
For fixed $V$ and $V^\pr$, we observe that~(\ref{eqn:tcz-inc}) is
equivalently to as a set of convex constraints called second order
conic constraints.  We define a second order conic constraint (SOCC)
as follows.
%
\begin{definition}[SOCC]
A constraint of the form $\|Ax\|_{2}+Fx+b\leq 0$ on an $n$-dimensional
variable $x$, given $A,F\in\mat{n}{k}{\realset}$ and $b\in\mb{R}^k$, is
called a second order conic constraint (SOCC).
\end{definition}
%
   Our aforementioned observation about~(\ref{eqn:tcz-inc}) is
 formalized below.
%
\begin{lemma}~\label{lem:zon-socc}
For fixed $V$,$V^\pr$, the partial order
$\cz{V^\pr}{c^\pr}{s^\pr}\order \cz{V}{c}{s}$ is equivalent to a set
of second order conic constraints on the variables
$c,c^\pr,s,s^\pr,l,l^\pr$ and some additional variables.
\end{lemma}
%
There are many convex optimization tools that can efficiently solve
second order conic constraints upto a high numerical precision.  We
also note that linear inequalities and equalities can be expressed in
the form of SOCC described above.
