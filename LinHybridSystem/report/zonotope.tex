Before we introduce augmented complex zonotopes, we briefly review
related set representations and discuss our motivation for the
current extension.

\subsection{Related set representations}
Usual zonotopes are Minkowski sums of
line segemnts, represented as a linear combination of real vectors,
called \emph{generators}, whose combining coefficients
are bounded in real valued intervals.
\begin{definition}[Real zonotope]
Let $W\in\mat{n}{k}{\mb{R}}$ and $l,u\in\mb{R}^m: l\leq u$.  Then the
following is a real zonotope.
\begin{equation*}
\zon{W}{l}{u} = \lt\{W\zeta: \zeta\in\mb{R}^k,~\zeta_j\in[l_j,u_j]~\forall j\in \tup{k}\rt\}
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

Zonotopes are a special class of polytopes.  In terms of hyperplane
representation, we define a polytope as follows.
%
\begin{definition}
Let $T\in\mat{n}{k}{\mb{R}}$ and $d\in\mb{R}^k$.  Then a (possibly
unbounded) polytope, denoted $\polytope{T}{d}$, is defined as
$\polytope{T}{d} = \lt\{x\in\comprealset^k: Tx\leq d\rt\}$.

\end{definition}

Although zonotopes are a special class of polytopes, they do not have
efficient hyperplane representation as a polytope.  A zonotope with
$m$ generators in an $n$ dimensional space can have as many as
${m}\choose{n}$ faces (bounding hyperplanes).  [GIVE EXAMPLE HERE].
The linear transformations and Minkowski sums of zonotopes are also
zonotopes, which can be computed efficiently.  Hence, zonotopes are
efficient for reachability analysis of linear systems and some special
cases of affine hybrid systems.  We will discuss these operations
latter in the general case of augmented complex zonotopes.

To incorporate possibly complex eigenstructure of linear maps while
finding invariants, the complex zonotope set representation and its
generalization to template complex zontopes was introduced
in~\cite{todo}.  A template complex zonotope has complex valued
vectors as generators, whose combining coefficients are complex and
bounded in their absolute values.

\begin{definition}[Template complex zonotope]
Let $V\in\mat{n}{m}{\mb{C}}$ (template) and $s\in\mb{R}^m_{\geq 0}$ (scaling factors) and
$c\in\mb{C}^n$ (center).  Then the following is a template complex zonotope.
\begin{equation*}
\cz{V}{c}{s} =
\lt\{V\epsilon:\epsilon\in\mb{C}^m,~\lt|\epsilon_i\rt|\leq s_i~\forall
i\in\tup{m}\rt\}
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

When the template vectors of a complex zonotope are real, then the
real projection of the complex zonotope is equivalent to a usual
zonotope and has a polytopic shape.  However, when some of the
template vectors have both real and imaginary parts, then the real
projection of a complex zonotope is a Minkowski sum of ellipsoids and
line segments, hence not polyheadral.  An example of the non-polyheadral
real projection of a complex zonotope is given in Figure~\ref{TODO}.

%% A major issue with using zonotopes for
%% analysis of affine hybrid systems is that there is no efficient way to
%% compute a reasonable zonotopic overapproximation of intersection with
%% linear guard conditions.  In case of usual zonotopes, a method for
%% computing the former was proposed in [TODO]~\cite{} that relied on
%% computing polytopic projections on different hyperplanes.  However,
%% this method is not efficient for high dimensions.  Furthermore, in case of
%% non-polyheadral complex zonotopes, to our knowledge there is no existing method to
%% overapproximate with reasonable accuracy the intersection with
%% linear guards as a complex zonotope. 

Generally, the intersection of a zonotope with linear constraints is
not a zonotope.  However, if the linear constraints constitute a
sub-parallelotope, then intersection with a zonotope with the
corresponding template can be exactly computed.  This is described in
the following lemma.
%
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:motivation}
Let $K\in\mat{n}{k}{R}$ such that $k\leq n$ and $\lt(K^TK\rt)$ is
non-singular.  Then
\[
\zon{K}{l}{u} \bigcap \sptope{\pinv{K}}{\wh{l}}{\wh{u}}
= \zon{K}{l\bigvee \wh{l}}{u\bigwedge \wh{u}}
\]
\end{lemma}
%

\subsection{Augmented complex zonotopes}
Lemma~\ref{lem:motivation} described the possibility of efficiently
computing intersection between a zonotope and a sub-parallelotope
under some assumption.  This being a motivation, we introduce a new
set representation called \emph{augmented complex zonotope}, which is
a Minkowski sum of a template complex zonotope and areal zonotope.

\begin{definition}[Augmented complex zonotope]
Let $V\in\mat{n}{m}{C}$ called primary template, $W\in\mat{n}{k}{R}$
called secondary template, $c\in\mb{R}^n$ called primary offset,
$s\in\mb{R}^m$ called scaling factors, $u,l\in\mb{R}^k$ called lower
and upper interval bounds, respectively, such that $l\leq u$.  The
following is an augmented complex
zonotope.
\begin{multline}
\gcz{V}{c}{s}{W}{l}{u} =
\lt\{
  c+V\epsilon+W\zeta:\epsilon\in\mb{C}^m,\zeta\in\mb{R}^k,\rt.\\ \lt.  \lt|\epsilon_i\rt|\leq
 s_i~\forall i\in\tup{m},~\zeta_j\in[l_j,u_j]~\forall j\in \tup{k}
\rt\}
\end{multline}
\end{definition}

The following 


We observe that the real zonotopic part of an augmented complex
zonotope can be used to represent bounded sub-parallelotopes.  Then
under suitable assumptions, intersection with sub-parallelotopes can
be exactly represented as an augmented complex zonotope and computed
easily.  These assumptions will be discussed in the next section.
Furthermore, we shall also state some relaxed assumptions under which
the intersection can be overapproximated, although not exactly
computed.
