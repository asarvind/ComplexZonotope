In the previous section, we derived a sufficient condition for an
augmented complex zonotope to be a positive invariant.  In this
section, we will discuss how to compute a positive invaraint based on
the sufficient condition.  The computation procedure involves two
steps.  In the first step, we choose suitable primary and secondary
templates for the augmented complex zonotope.  In the next step, we
solve for the other variables that satisfy the sufficient condition
derived in Theorem~\ref{thm:main}.
