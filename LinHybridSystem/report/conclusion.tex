Augmented complex zonotopes overcome the drawback of template complex
zonotopes in that intersection with linear guard conditions can be
reasonably overapproximated, which can be used for efficient invariant
computation.  As such, our invariant computation procedure based on
augmented complex zonotopes have a three advantages.  First is that,
like template complex zonotopes, we can meaningfully choose the
templates based on the eigenstructure of the dynamics and other
characteristics.  Second is that unlike step-by-step reachability
computation approaches that can accumulate overapproximation error in
each step, we compute an invariant in a single convex optimization
step, where the optimizer inherently tries to minimize the
overapproximation error in only one step.  Third is that we can
reasonably overapproximate the intersection with linear guard
conditions and specify it as a part of the convex optimization program
for invariant computation, which was earlier not possible with
template complex zonotopes.
