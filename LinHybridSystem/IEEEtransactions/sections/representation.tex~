Before introducing the resresentation of a complex zonotope, we shall
briefly describe a simple/real valued zonotope representation.  A
simple zonotope consists of points generated by a linear combination
of real valued vectors translated by a center such that the combining
coefficients are bounded inside symmetric intervals.  Geometrically
speaking, a real zonotope is a Minkowski sum of line segments.  It can
be represented by matrix of generators and a center, as follows.
%
\begin{definition}
Let us consider $\stemp\in\mat{n}{k}{\reals}$ and $\cen\in\reals^n$.
A real zonotope is represented as follows.
%
\[
\rztope{\stemp}{\cen} = \set{\stemp\zeta:~\zeta_i\in[-1,1]~\forall i\in\set{1,\ldots,k}}.
\]

\end{definition}
