In a generalized complex zonotope,
a subset of the combining coefficients are real and bounded in real
intervals, while the rest are complex and bounded in their
absolute values.

\begin{definition}
Let $V\in\mat{n}{m}{C}$ called primary template, $W\in\mat{n}{k}{R}$
called secondary template, $c\in\mb{R}^n$ called primary offset,
$s\in\mb{R}^m$ called scaling factors, $u,l\in\mb{R}^k$ called lower
and upper interval bounds, respectively, such that $l\leq u$.  The
following is a generalized complex
zonotope.
\begin{multline}
\gcz{V}{c}{s}{W}{u}{l} =
\lt\{
  c+V\epsilon+W\zeta:\epsilon\in\mb{C}^m,\zeta\in\mb{R}^k,\rt.\\ \lt.  \lt|\epsilon_i\rt|\leq
 s_i~\forall i\in\tup{m},~\zeta_j\in[l_j,u_j]~\forall j\in \tup{k}
\rt\}
\end{multline}
\end{definition}
